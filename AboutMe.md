<body class>
<p>I'm a passionate data scientist with a strong foundation in mathematics and statistics. I earned my Bachelor's in Mathematics from the University of North Georgia and recently completed my Master's in Statistics at North Carolina State University. With over 8 years at Cardlytics—a leading fintech company specializing in banking reward programs—I’ve grown from a Forecast Analyst into a Transactions Analyst, using data-driven insights to support decision-making and business growth.

My path to data science hasn’t followed a straight line. I was born and raised in Ft. Lauderdale, FL, spending my early years playing baseball and street hockey, and even working as a child model—appearing in commercials and print campaigns for brands like Hertz, Coppertone, Fisher-Price, and Ralph Lauren. Later, my family moved to Atlanta, where I found discipline and leadership through JROTC rifle and drill teams, high school football, and earning a green belt in karate.

Before entering the analytics world, I served eight years in the U.S. Marine Corps, including a tour in Afghanistan. Those years taught me resilience, adaptability, and a deep sense of responsibility—qualities I now bring into my work every day.</p>

<p>I chose to pursue graduate studies at NC State because I’ve never been able to resist the pull of learning. I love math—especially statistics—and solving problems gives me a sense of purpose and clarity. That constant curiosity is a driving force in my life, so I make time every day to learn, build, and grow.

Though my formal education has concluded, my learning journey is far from over. I’ve recently begun training for a commercial pilot’s license—just for the fun of it! One day, I hope to combine my passion for flying and service by volunteering with organizations like Civil Air Patrol or Angel Flights, providing transportation to those in need.

Outside of work, I enjoy spending time with my wife and our large, lively family, playing the piano, riding motorcycles, lifting weights, attending church, and keeping my lawn and garden in top shape.</p>
