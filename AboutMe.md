<body class>
<p>I am a passionate data scientist with a strong foundation in mathematics and statistics. I earned my Bachelor's degree in Mathematics from the University of North Georgia and will soon complete my Master's in Statistics from North Carolina State University. With over 8 years of experience at Cardlytics, a leading FINTECH company specializing in customer engagement with banking reward programs, I have honed my expertise as both a Forecast Analyst and a Transactions Analyst, leveraging data-driven insights to drive business success.</p>

<p>My journey to data science has been anything but conventional. Born and raised in Ft. Lauderdale, FL, I was brought up playing baseball, street hockey, and even modeled for an agency on South Beach appearing in magazines, digital print, and TV commercials for brands such as Hertz, Coppertone, Fisher-Price, and Ralph Lauren. My family eventually relocated to Atlanta, GA where I developed discipline and leadership through JROTC Rifle/Drill teams, high school football, and earning a green belt in karate. Prior to my career in analytics, I served eight years in the U.S. Marine Corps, including a tour in Afghanistan. These experiences instilled in me a strong work ethic, adaptability, and a commitment to excellence.</p>

<p>I turned to North Carolina State because I cannot help myself in continuing to learn.  I love mathematics and specifically statistics.  Planning and solving problems gives me a sense of completion and usefulness.  That hunger for knowledge is a daily gnawing that I do not think I will ever get a break from and so I have decided to simply embrace it by dedicated ample time each day in development. </p>

<p>While my years at formal education may be winding down, the learning never ends.  I decided to do something a little different and fun and go earn a commercial pilot's license. I love to fly and I hope someday I can marry my passion for flight and for service by volunteering with organizations like the Civil Air Patrol or Angel Flights, helping families in need.</p>

<p>Outside of work, I enjoy attending church, spending time with my wife and large family, playing the piano, weightlifting, motorcycling, and maintaining my lawn and garden.</p>
