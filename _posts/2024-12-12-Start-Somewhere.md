excerpt: "Making a move in the general direction of where you are trying to get to is often times the hardest part.  Other times, knowing where you want to go or even wanting to go where you know you need to go presents resistance and challenges.  One foot in front of the other.  Once your feet start moving--progress!"

"Hello, World!", in keeping with computer tradition.

I decided to start this website and blog as a dfeature to highlight my professional journey. For years, I have spent over a decade interested in mathematics and statistics, and this website will hopefully serve to showcase the work that I do there in this beloved field. Truth be told, I should have begun this blog much sooner—perhaps around the 2020 COVID year, or sooner! So many interesting things have happened since then and there are many stories worth sharing—in due time.

Over the weekend I came across some advice from a career coach suggesting that people in my line of work create a space to disply their work for others to see. I decided that was good advice, therefore I learned enough HTML and Ruby to quickly put a site together. Although it was templated by HTML5 UP, the code is heavily customized.  It may not look like much right now, I have an entire GitHub repo full of work to post. That will be a milestone.  It’s just going to take some time to set up and display. Thanks for your patience.

The most difficult part of any project, or anything worth doing, this website included, is always that very first step. It is a mixture of overthinking, uncertainty, and perhaps a little pride. I think about the times my calendar says I’m supposed to be at the gym and I talk myself out of it. I say, "Ah! I’m too tired," "...too full," "...too busy," or "I’m just not feeling it today." There are times when the kids are about to have their 11th recital in a month and you just want to take a break just this one time. So how do you overcome these adversarial thoughts?

I will save my personal comeback story from the 2000s for another blog post, but the central issue of that life event was that it took over a decade to return to school after a prolonged absence. There were obstacles, paperwork, praying, perseverance—all the things. It took commitment, resolve, and a friend to tell me some hard truths and push me from behind to get me back into school.

Then there are those moments when the first step is an actual step and not a mental one.

For the recitals or the gym, just walk to the car. Don’t dither and give your mind the opportunity for excuse-making. Just go. You defeat that kind of thinking before it ever takes root by just doing.

Like with this website, applying for grad school, interviewing for my day job, attending recitals, doing yard work, or meeting family for coffee and conversation; not always, but sometimes, the direction doesn’t even matter—move your feet and go.  You know what?  Every time I have started off on the journey; regardless of whether I arrived at my destination, I have never once said I regreted it.  I learned or grew in each instance.  Whatver you set your heart or mind out to do; commit and go. Bringing a friend along helps too.
