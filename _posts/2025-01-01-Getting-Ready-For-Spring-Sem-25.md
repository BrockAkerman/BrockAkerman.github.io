This semester marks the second-to-last chapter of my formal education, and there is a sense of bittersweetness as I approach its conclusion. My experience at NC State and within my academic program has been deeply fulfilling. One lingering regret involves not living closer to campus or participating in in-person classes. There is something inherently different about taking courses onlineâ€”perhaps it is the absence of the academic atmosphere that comes with walking into a building and attending classes in person.

During my undergraduate years, I formed connections with fellow students who shared my course pathway. We often gathered in the math lab, tackling homework problems and discussing concepts over 8 p.m. coffee sessions. Reflecting on those times, it becomes clear that the in-person experience fostered a unique sense of camaraderie and shared purpose that I continue to miss.

As I near the end of my journey in the Masters of Statistics Program at NC State, I plan to write a comprehensive reflection on my experiences here. For now, I can confidently say that my time in this program has been overwhelmingly positive.

In the immediate future, I am preparing to take a course on Big Data Analysis. According to the syllabus, it will focus heavily on Python, incorporating statistical concepts throughout the curriculum. My history with Python involves picking it up, setting it aside, and revisiting it later. This pattern of inconsistent engagement has slowed my learning process. However, this course promises to provide structure and accountability, which I believe are critical elements often missing in self-directed studies that depend heavily on personal discipline.

At work, I am simultaneously leading several projects, which has proven instrumental in improving my time management skills while allowing me to achieve measurable successes. Last month, I built a webpage from scratch by teaching myself CSS, Ruby, HTML, and Java. The process took nearly a month to finalize, but the outcome reflects my vision. I am not certain what initially inspired me to learn these languages, but they have already proven valuable. Recently, I have been assisting a coworker in navigating the HTML code of a proprietary website integral to our daily operations.

As has often been the case in recent months and years, I find myself juggling more tasks than I have time or energy to manage comfortably. Nevertheless, I continue to approach each day with the mindset of taking one step at a time and maintaining forward momentum. That is how I intend to see everything through to completion.
