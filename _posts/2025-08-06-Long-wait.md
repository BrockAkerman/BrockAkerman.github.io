No sooner had I launched this GitHub website than my spring semester kicked offâ€”and itâ€™s been a whirlwind ever since. From the moment classes began, itâ€™s been a full-on sprint.

This past spring, I enrolled in a Python-based course and dove deep into the language and its applications. We worked in Google Colab, explored how Netflix uses Apache Iceberg, and built data pipelines using Pandas and Spark. It was intenseâ€”but incredibly rewarding.

Over the summer, I wrapped up my final course: a capstone project in collaboration with a researcher from the College of Veterinary Medicine. My team and I worked with survey data from veterinary dental professionals to uncover insights and support ongoing research. You can check out the project and its findings in the [Portfolio](/portfolio/) section of this site.

ðŸŽ“ **And with thatâ€”Iâ€™ve officially graduated.**

I'll write more soon about the graduation itself and what lies ahead, but for now, Iâ€™m going to enjoy a little downtime. After five years of keeping my nose to the grindstone, Iâ€™m finally taking a breathâ€”and spending time with my wife and kids, who are probably just as relieved to have me back as I am to be home.

Stay tuned.
